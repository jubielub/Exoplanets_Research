# Exoplanets_Research

Program Objectives:

1. Reads exoplanets' physical and stellar property and sodium and potassium absorption data from 'Stellar, Planetary, Absorption Data' page in 
'Spring-19 Planets Stellar, Parameter, Na & K Absorption Data' Google Sheet (using Google Sheets API)
2. Plots planets on a scatter plot based on any two physical and/or stellar properties and indicates which planets have absolute, potential, and no absorption of sodium and/or potassium
3. Saves all created plots to indicated file path in personal computer. 

Steps to take prior to running this program:

1. Download 'parameterplotdata-d463b21ec310.json' file from Parameter_Plot_Program folder in Github. Save file to same folder this program's .py file is saved in. 
2. In the 'INPUTS AND VARIABLES TO CHANGE:' section of the program - set the variable strFile to the file path of the Folder you want the plots generated by the program to be saved to.
