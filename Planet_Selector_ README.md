Program Objectives:
1) Find exoplanets in a selected scope consisting of two physical or orbital properties.
2) Generate a .csv file that lists exoplanets in the selected scope along with their physical and orbital property meansurements.
3) Plots the exoplanets in the selected scope based on two properties on a scatter plot with a red box indicating the scope.
4) Allows user to save scatter plot and .csv file to personal files. 

Steps to take prior to running this program: 
1) Create a folder named ‘Exoplanets’ on your computer. Create a subfolder within that folder called ‘Planet_Selector’. Create a subfolder within the Planet_Selector folder named Data. 
2) Go to hzgallery.org and click on the ‘Table’ header. Click on the option to download the table csv file to your computer.
3) Go to your downloads folder and move the .csv file (currently called table.csv) to the Data folder you just created. 
4) Rename the csv file ‘hzGallery.csv’  
5) Download Updated_Planet_Selector_vMay2020.py to the ‘Planet_Selector’ folder in your computer and open it in Spyder IDE.
6) Follow the instructions in the “INPUTS & VARIABLES TO CHANGE” section of the program. 
Note: You may need to make some modifications to the file path of the file with HZG data pasted in the program to make sure your program is able to properly access the .csv file.
